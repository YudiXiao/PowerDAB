# PowerDAB
Simulation app and source code to calculate power flow of dual active bridge based converters.

Please check our paper for the capabilities of PowerDAB.

If you would just need basic calculations, try to use the simulation app.

For advanced model based optimization/design, try to download the source code.

Please write to us if you found any bugs.

You are very welcome to propose nice-to-have functions for the simulation app. 

Have fun!
