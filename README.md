# PowerDAB
Simulation app and source code to calculate power flow of dual active bridge based converters.

Please check our paper for the capabilities of PowerDAB.

If you would just need basic calculations, try to use the simulation app.

For advanced model based optimization, try to down load the source code and use the functins inside.

Have fun!
