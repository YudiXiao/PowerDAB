# PowerDAB

## What it is
Simulation app and source code to calculate power flow of dual active bridge based converters.

Please check our paper for the capabilities of PowerDAB. Link to paper:


## How to use
If you would just need basic calculations, try to use the simulation app, which is an easy-to-run executable.

For advanced model based optimization/design, try to download the source code of the app. You could open it with MATLAB and directly copy out the functions.


## More you can do
Please write to us if you found any bugs or would like to put your comments on the app. Thanks a lot in advance!

You are also very welcome to propose nice-to-have functions for the simulation app. We appreciate your ideas.


## Have fun!
